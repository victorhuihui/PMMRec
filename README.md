# PMMRec: Path-enhanced Mixture-of-Experts for Multimodal Recommendation

<!-- PROJECT LOGO -->

## Introduction

This is the Pytorch implementation for our PMMRec paper:

>PMMRec: Path-enhanced Mixture-of-Experts for Multimodal Recommendation

## Environment Requirement
- python 3.9
- Pytorch 2.1.0

## Dataset

Due to the large size of the dataset and website upload limitations, 
we will release all datasets promptly after the paper is accepted. 
Furthermore, you can easily obtain the same dataset used in this paper from our baseline method.

## Training
  ```
  cd ./src
  python main.py
  ```

## Acknowledgement
